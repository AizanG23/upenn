        <p>Dear Aizan Gul,</p>

        <p>Congratulations! You are invited to join the Class of 2031 at the University of Pennsylvania for study in the <strong>Wharton School</strong>.</p>

        <p>It's time to celebrate! Extending this invitation to you means many things. It means high-fiving with the Quaker mascot and throwing toast onto Franklin Field. It means a late-night trip for a Philly cheesesteak (or a steak substitute of your choice—believe me, Philly's got every diet covered). It means learning with our extraordinary faculty members as you discover your next great pursuit, favorite book, or fresh idea. It means there are people here—who you haven't even met yet—who are waiting to cheer you on, lift you up, and help you grow.</p>

        <p>The admissions team evaluated thousands of applications, looking for students who were not only exceptional on their own but also committed to contributing to a larger community. We selected <em>you</em> because you demonstrate empathy, openness to different perspectives, intellectual dedication, and genuine curiosity. We're confident you will use these strengths to enrich our campus, just as the Penn community will help you grow in return.</p>

        <p>Benjamin Franklin, our founder, was a <em>creator</em>. His relentless curiosity and his willingness to persist through setbacks fueled his creation of many inventions that still exist in our 21st century lives—including the lightning rod, bifocals, and odometers (I bet that's a word you never thought you'd see in a college acceptance letter!). He also envisioned a school that would provide a comprehensive, curiosity-driven education to prepare its students to use their knowledge to benefit the world. Upon that revolutionary promise, he founded the University of Pennsylvania as the first university in this country.</p>

        <p>We are grateful that you have given us the opportunity to imagine the University of Pennsylvania with you as part of our community. We can see <em>you</em> here, on Locust Walk, catching up with friends, heading to class, rehearsal, or to a study group. We can picture <em>you</em> falling in love with Philadelphia and feeling like you've found your next home. We can't wait to welcome <em>you</em> to campus. Believe me when I say: you belong here.</p>

        <p>Congratulations again!</p>

        <div class="signature">
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive; font-size: 2.5em; margin: 0; color: #1a1a1a;">E. Whitney Soule</p>
